        As a kid, I loved tinkering with computers, but everything changed in
        2010 when I got my first Android phone. Discovering I could create
        applications sparked my passion for development. I started learning Java
        and Android development from YouTube during high school, which set me on
        a path to pursue this passion further in university.

        One thing led to another, and I began my career as an Android developer.
        Along the way, I explored web and backend development, which broadened
        my perspective on the immense impact of software engineering. In my
        early 20s, I developed a fascination for microcontrollers and
        electronics, bridging the gap between software and the physical world.
        This passion led me to create Bluetooth-enabled cars, robots, and home
        automation projects.

        Inspired by YouTube content creators, I decided to share my own projects
        and journey with the world. I’m constantly learning, growing, and
        expanding my horizons, always eager to explore what’s next.
